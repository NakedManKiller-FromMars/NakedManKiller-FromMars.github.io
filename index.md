## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Hi I'm Oscar
This is my first git project
Actually it is not, I altered it while doing my IBI portfolio
I'm glad that I'm finishing my portfolio of IBI1
It is hard coding with python to do tough tasks, but it is also fun sensing myself leaning new things and improving.
I've learned a lot in this course thanks to Melanie, Mikael, Xin Chen, Gedi and many other teachers and faculty.
Thank u all :)
